# Solo
An Openfire plugin for creating a blog website using Solo from b3log.org

The blog users are Openfire users with access controlled by a group. The group admin is the blog admin. It uses the httpFileUpload plugin to upload all media referenced from the website. Email notification is sent via Openfire (if configured).
